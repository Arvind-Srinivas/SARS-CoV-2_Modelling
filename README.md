This study utilizes an epidemiology model to uncover what conditions would cause the evolution of increased persistence at the metapopulation level. A foundational extended SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model was implemented. By incorporating factors such as intrinsic reproductive numbers for both short-term and persistent infections, and the immunity waning rate, this model aims to simulate various epidemiological scenarios. The objective is to identify the key parameters and conditions that enable the virus to maintain its presence within a population over extended periods, despite public health interventions and widespread immunity. The model can be considered as a null model, serving as a baseline framework that assumes minimal complexity to provide a reference point for understanding the dynamics of viral persistence. Overall, if the number of long-term/persistent infections increase over an extended period, then persistence is being selected for as an ESS. 
	Determining the conditions that favor the selection of persistence can help predict the trajectory of persistent infections and the virus's evolution. If the model accurately predicts an increase in persistent infections under specific conditions, real-time monitoring can validate its accuracy by comparing trends in studies that either support or contradict the modelâ€™s predictions. 

*Continuing to enhance this null model to more accurately describe persistence dynamics at the meta-population level. The ultimate goal is to publish this work.*
